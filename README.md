# Project Overview

This project is mainly focusing on utilizing the technology of deep learning models to help us detect different emotions of people in an image. Emotion detection is a way to understand people better in social settings in a way that it detects human feelings like happy, sad, surprised at a specific moment without actually asking them. It is useful in many areas like security, investigation and healthcare. After finished training the models, we are also planning to develop a emotion detection website, which will allow users to upload an image, and then we can generate the appropriate emotion of the person in the image.

# Potential Use Cases 

Although the app's functionality is based on static images. In the long run, we would love to develop a model/app that can work dynamically (i.e. take motion into account to record someone's emotion). This would mean that someone's emotional state will be recorded over the course of a certain period of time when looking into a camera. Then, the emotional states will be used to know how the person felt at different points of the conversation. They can also build emotional frequency charts to display how the frequency of the person's emotional state over the course of the conversation. Some use cases of this app are interviewing, customer support and healthcare. Interviewers can utilize the website's ability to recognize interviewees' emotions and understand what their interviewees are going through during an interview. This will assist them with dealing with other interviewees in the future. Healthcare providers can also use this website's functionalities to know what a patient was feeling during a medical treatment, so they provide care for prospective patients without subjecting them to too much pain. Customer support representatives can use this website's ability to gain knowledge about how their customers feel so they can understand how to have better conversations with other customers in the future that will satisfy their customers' demands
